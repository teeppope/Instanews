#The Instanews App Project

This project held a myriad of challenges and rewards to be found. Using new tools learned in class, I was able to add depth to my webpage, and increase the speed at which I am able to develop through the use of the Gulp build tool.

The instanews app project required us to hook into the New York Times API using the .ajax() request method. Using this method in combination with other jQuery methods, I was able to pull out 12 top stories for a news section of choice, with some key pieces of associated information based off design mockups to produce a dynamic web layout.

##Technology used in this project is as follows:
HTML5- For the basic website structure
SASS/CSS- For styling my webpage
Gulp- For automating my development process, and minifying my files
jQuery- For adding dynamic range and getting information out of the NYT API

##How I felt about the tech used.
Using SCSS & gulp sass, I was able to create modular .css styles through the SASS syntax. Allowing me to keep my files more organized and easily editable with the use of variables and mixins. I'm looking forward to better understanding SCSS.

Gulp gave me the opportunity to speed up be development process through the use of different npm packages, even allowing me to auto reload the webpage after every save. It was a bit tough to wrap my head around initially, but once figured out, and after deleting and re-installing a couple times just to understand the process a bit better, it really clicked, and I'm excited to get to learn more npm plugins for gulp!

Using jQuery was mostly a lot of trial and error trying to find the right methods and functions to use, and when to use them, but keeping my brackets organized at least helped a bit. Google was a fantastic resource for helping out in a pinch, but getting to a place where the jQuery works, just feels so good!

##Reflection

This project challeneged me, I left it a bit to the last minute, and so trying to develop under a tightish timeline left me wanting for a deeper understanding of javascript and for my past self to have procrastinated less. After this experience I know I want to get to understand javascript better, and just keep practicing it. I enjoyed traversing through the API, picking out key pieces of information and styling them. There was a lot of trial and error to sort through all the key pieces of information but this only helped me to understand the logic just even a little bit better.
